# Tender Writing Assistant - Fixed Issues

## Identified and Fixed Issues

1. **Blob Storage Token Invalid**
   - Issue: The original Blob Storage token was not valid or properly formatted
   - Fix: Updated with a valid token in the `.env.local` file
   - Verification: Successfully tested connectivity via the debug API endpoint

2. **Document Upload and Persistence Issues**
   - Issue: Uploaded documents were not being properly stored and retrieved from Blob Storage
   - Fix: Enhanced error handling and debugging in the Blob Storage implementation
   - Verification: Successfully uploaded and retrieved both source and company documents

3. **Tender Generation Failure**
   - Issue: The tender generation API was failing because it couldn't find any documents
   - Fix: Fixed the document storage and retrieval process
   - Verification: Successfully generated a tender with both source and company documents

## Steps to Reproduce Working Functionality

1. **Upload Source Documents**
   ```
   curl -X POST -F "file=@your-file.txt" http://localhost:3002/api/tender/sources
   ```

2. **Upload Company Documents**
   ```
   curl -X POST -F "file=@your-file.txt" http://localhost:3002/api/tender/company-docs
   ```

3. **Generate Tender**
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query":"Generate a tender"}' http://localhost:3002/api/tender/generate
   ```

## Important Implementation Details

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` must be a valid Vercel Blob Storage token
   - The token must be properly formatted and have sufficient permissions
   - The token is currently set correctly in `.env.local`

2. **Blob Storage Structure**
   - Source documents: Stored with prefix `tender-source-docs/`
   - Company documents: Stored with prefix `tender-company-docs/`
   - Each document has a JSON metadata file and possibly a binary file for PDFs

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/api/tender/sources` - Manage source documents
   - `/api/tender/company-docs` - Manage company documents
   - `/api/tender/generate` - Generate tenders based on documents
   - `/api/debug` - Check environment variables and Blob Storage connectivity

## Next Steps

1. **Web Interface Integration**
   - The API endpoints are now working correctly
   - Next step is to ensure the web interface is properly calling these endpoints
   - Make sure file uploads are correctly formatted multipart/form-data

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Enhanced error messages are now provided for better debugging
   - Consider adding a dedicated error logging system for production

3. **Document Management**
   - Consider adding document tagging or categorization
   - Implement document versioning if needed
