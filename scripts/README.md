# Document Indexing Process

## Status

We've successfully implemented a document indexing API endpoint using the Pages Router at `/api/index-docs`. 

The API endpoint is working and can be accessed, but there's an issue with the Pinecone API key. The error message indicates that the Pinecone API key is invalid or rejected.

## How to Fix

1. Go to [Pinecone Console](https://app.pinecone.io/) and get a new API key for your project.
2. Update the `.env` file with the new API key:

```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=tender-documents
```

3. Restart the Next.js server after updating the environment variables.

## Testing the Indexing Process

We have created a test script at `scripts/test-index.js` that can be used to test the document indexing process:

```bash
node scripts/test-index.js
```

This script will:
1. Check if the API endpoint is available
2. Send a POST request to index the documents
3. Display the results of the indexing process

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/index-docs
Returns a message indicating the API is working.

### POST /api/index-docs
Indexes the documents in Pinecone with the following request body:

```json
{
  "action": "index",  // or "reindex" or "clear"
  "refresh": true     // optional, forces reloading of documents from storage
}
```

## Next Steps

1. Update the Pinecone API key in the `.env` file
2. Run the test script to verify the documents are indexed correctly
3. Once indexing is working, proceed with implementing the multi-agent orchestration system for tender generation
